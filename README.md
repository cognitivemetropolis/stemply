*stemply* is simply STEM. It is the standard Raspbian OS Debian deployment with special software to keep kids safe on the Internet. You can learn all about it here: https://www.cognitivemetropolis.com/2019/08/28/meet-stemply/   *stemply* is a full desktop computer workstation with no ads, no viruses, no tracking, no malware, safe web filtering technology, advanced firewall protection, and peace of mind built-in. 

 We could never get *stemply* to compress enough to upload a Binary. :(  So, here is a link to the free download. Again its a binary and all source and configurations are included in the Binary. https://www.cognitivemetropolis.com/product/get-stemply/
 
    Download Etcher from https://www.etcher.io It is the easiest tool to burn .img files and cross-platform as well.

    Insert your MicroSDHD Card into your computer and start Etcher. The Etcher site explains how to use the tool and details what to do. However, here is an overview: -find the .img file (AMENDMENT1_1.0.img) by clicking "Select Image" in Etcher. -click "Select Drive" and locate the MicroSDHD card inserted into your computer -click "Flash" and wait for completion (you may have to enter the admin password to begin)

    Once complete, insert the MicroSDHD card into the Raspberry Pi3 B+ and power it on. Now you are ready to start using stemply.
